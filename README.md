# 📡 NETRA - Network Recon and Auditing Toolkit

**NETRA (Network Recon and Auditing Toolkit)** is a high-performance, multi-functional utility suite designed for deep network discovery, security auditing, and wireless analysis on local area networks (LANs) and Wi-Fi environments.

This multi-tool efficiently consolidates the core functionalities of several network utilities into a single, optimized **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application. It is built using Python, Scapy, and multi-threading for fast, reliable, and low-level network interactions.

## 🛠️ Key Features

| Functionality | Description | Technical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🌐 Host Discovery** | Fast ARP and Ping scanning to quickly map active hosts (IP, MAC) on the local network segment. | Utilizes **Scapy's low-level packet crafting** for efficiency. |
| **⚡ Optimized Port Scanning** | Checks common TCP/UDP ports to determine running services and capture banners. | Employs **Multi-threading** (`ThreadPoolExecutor`) for **high-speed, concurrent port checks**. |
| **🆔 OUI/Vendor Lookup** | Analyzes the MAC Address of discovered devices to accurately identify the Manufacturer (Vendor). | Requires an `oui.txt` file for local, offline lookup. |
| **🛡️ Wi-Fi Auditing & Stress Testing** | Advanced tools for interface mode management, network reconnaissance, and **testing resilience against deauthentication** attacks and rogue access points. | Requires root privileges and interface must be in **Monitor Mode** for many functions. |

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**
* **Linux/Unix Operating System** (Required for low-level network access and Scapy integration).
* **Root/Administrator Privileges** (Required for ARP scanning, Wi-Fi auditing, and interface manipulation).

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone the NETRA repository
git clone [https://github.com/akbas70/NETRA.git](https://github.com/akbas70/NETRA.git)
cd NETRA

# Install required libraries, including Scapy
pip3 install scapy

# Get the OUI database for vendor lookup (optional, but recommended)
# You may need to manually place or update an 'oui.txt' file.

Usage

Run the main application file using elevated privileges and specify the command:
Bash

sudo python netra.py [command] -h

Example Usage:

    Port Scan: sudo python3 main.py scan -t 192.168.1.1 --ports 1-1000

    ARP Scan: sudo python3 main.py wireless netscan -i eth0 -r 192.168.1.0/24
